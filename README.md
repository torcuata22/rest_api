# rest_api

A simple RESTful API built in Go for creating, updating, and managing events.

Features:

- Full CRUD support for events (create, update, delete, retrieve)
- User authentication with secure endpoints
- Ownership logic: only event creators can modify or delete their events
- Lightweight and fast, using SQLite for local development

Tech stack:

- Go (Golang)
- Gorilla Mux
- SQLite
- JWT Authentication

This is an ideal project to use as a starting point for larger Go-based backend services.
